# Support Vector Machine (SVM)

## Story

The most common tasks in Machine Learning are classification, regression and outliers detection.  Among many algorithms, SVM is one which is used to solve the aforementioned tasks. You can use it to detect cancerous cells based on millions of images or you can use it to predict future driving routes with a well-fitted regression model.

* You're free to look at any other source for related materials. However, we strongly discourage you to copy/paste any code.

## What you need to do

### Part I
* Familiarize yourself with basics of Machine Learning.
* Explore Support Virtual Machines - its different types, practical use-cases and algorithmic analysis. You are also supposed to explore the sci-kit learn library for SVMs.
* You need to make a presentation explaining what is SVM and how is it different from other popular Machine Learning algorithms (ex. kNNs, etc.) your thought process and how / why you choose a certain tool while solving this problem.

### Part II
* Pick a dataset (from ex. [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)).
* Write a code, using sci-kit learn (svm), to perform a non-linear classification. However, keep in mind that you will be required to explain the working of the algorithm you have used.
* A GitHub repository which contains your code(Jupyter notebook OR python file) along with a `.md` file containing your thought process would be the end product that we are expecting. 

## Tech-Stack
* You can use Python/R and any library of your choice.

## Learning from the task

Remember that understanding the working of the algorithm that you have used is more important, rather than striving to improve the accuracy of the algorithm. You are encouraged to look up blogs, technical write-ups and understand the mathematics behind the algorithm. 

_We are more curious about your thinking ability and practical utility than the final result._
