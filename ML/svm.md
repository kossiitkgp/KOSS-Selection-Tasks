# Support Vector Machine (SVM)

## Story

The most common tasks in Machine Learning are classification, regression, and outlier detection.  Among many algorithms, SVM is used to solve the aforementioned tasks. You can use it to detect cancerous cells based on millions of images, or you can use it to predict future driving routes using a well-fitted regression model.

## What you need to do

### Part I
* Familiarize yourself with the basics of Machine Learning.
* Explore Support Virtual Machines - its different types, practical use-cases, and algorithmic analysis. You are also supposed to explore the sci-kit learn library for SVMs.
* You need to make a presentation explaining what SVM is and how it differs from other popular Machine Learning algorithms (ex. kNNs, etc.) your thought process and how / why you chose a certain tool while solving this problem.

### Part II
* Pick a dataset (from ex. [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)).
* Write a code without using sci-kit learn to perform non-linear classification. However, keep in mind that you will be required to explain the working of the algorithm you have used. You may use NumPy and Pandas for data manipulation.
* A GitHub repository that contains your code(Jupyter Notebook OR python file) along with a `.md` file containing your thought process would be the end product that we are expecting. 

## Tech-Stack
* You can use Python/R and any library of your choice.

## Learning from the task

Remember that understanding the workings of the algorithm you have used is more important than striving to improve the accuracy of the algorithm. You are encouraged to look up blogs, technical write-ups and understand the mathematics behind the algorithm. 

_We are more curious about your thinking ability and practical utility than the final result._
