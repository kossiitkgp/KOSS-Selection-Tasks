# Price prediction

## Story

What is is that differentates a Lamborghini from a Toyota? Why is a Mercedes-Benz pricier than a Suzuki? And what if you could predict the price of a car from tis features like length, mileage, width, etc. This dataset gives you a list of several cars and their features along with their corresponding prices. Try and use machine learning algorithms to build a model that predicts the price based on these features.

## Materials
* The dataset of automobiles can be found [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/automobile)

## What you need to do

* Explore and clean the data. Determine the features that are the most useful to your model.
* You may use libraries like sci-kit learn. However, keep in mind that you will be required to explain the working of the algorithm you have used.
* You need to document your approach in a `.md` file explaining your thought process and how / why you choose a certain tool while solving this problem.
* A GitHub repository which contains your code(Jupyter notebook OR python file) along with a `.md` file containing your thought process would be the end product that we are expecting. 
* _Bonus task_ - Use seaborn to visualize the data

## Tech-Stack
* You can use Python/R and any library of your choice.

## Learning from the task

Remember that understanding the working of the algorithm that you have used is more important, rather than striving to improve the accuracy of the algorithm. You are encouraged to look up blogs, technical write-ups and understand the mathematics behind the algorithm. 

_We are more curious about your thinking ability and practical utility than the final result._
