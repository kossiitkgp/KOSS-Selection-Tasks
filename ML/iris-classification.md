# Data classification

## Story

Classification is one of the fundamental machine learning algorithms and is applied in various fields. Depending on various features, datapoints can be classified into different classes, for example, measuring a triangle's angles, we can classify it as acute-angled, obtuse-angled or right angled. In this task, however, you will be dealing with data that is slightly more interesting. You will be classifying the type of flower based on its measured features.

## Materials
* The dataset of iris flowers can be found [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris)

## What you need to do

* Explore and clean the data. Use the appropriate algorithm to classify the datapoints.
* You may use libraries like sci-kit learn. However, keep in mind that you will be required to explain the working of the algorithm you have used.
* You need to document your approach in a `.md` file explaining your thought process and how / why you choose a certain tool while solving this problem.
* A GitHub repository which contains your code(Jupyter notebook OR python file) along with a `.md` file containing your thought process would be the end product that we are expecting. 
* _Bonus task 1_ - Use seaborn to visualize the data

## Tech-Stack
* You can use Python/R and any library of your choice.

## Learning from the task

Remember that understanding the working of the algorithm that you have used is more important, rather than striving to improve the accuracy of the algorithm. You are encouraged to look up blogs, technical write-ups and understand the mathematics behind the algorithm. 

_We are more curious about your thinking ability and practical utility than the final result._
