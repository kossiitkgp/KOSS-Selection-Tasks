# Object Oriented Programming (Features and comparative study)

## Background

<div align="justify">
There are several approaches to programming paradigms. But the two most popular and important ones are procedural programming and object-oriented programming. From a beginner’s point of view, procedural programming is easier to learn and more simple to use. But as your application grows and your codebase becomes larger, development and maintenance of your code becomes more difficult. This is where OOP comes to the rescue. OOP makes your code easier to debug and provides better flexibility and reusability. The ever-growing popularity of Object Oriented Programming and Object Oriented Languages stand to testify the benefits of the paradigm.

## What you need to do

<div align="justify">
The interviewee needs to make a presentation (keep the presentation simple; a simple PowerPoint presentation is good enough). The interviewee needs to keep in mind that the crowd he will be presenting to, will have mixed people of different knowledge levels, so it is advised that to keep the content balanced for all, touch upon both basics and advanced topics in the domains below. Your presentation should mainly consist of the following parts.
</div>

* Give an introduction to paradigms of programming keeping in focus object oriented programming and its distinguishing features that make it very special. For example the following points can be elaborated on OOP by pointing out the What, Why and How's. 
	* Comparison between structures and classes
    * A discussion on the four pillars of OOP: Encapsulation, Abstraction, Polymorphism and Inheritance.
    * Method and operator overloading
    * A brief discussion on access specifiers and data hiding
    * Virtual and Abstract Functions
    * Constructors and Destructors
    * Garbage collection in OOP languages
* Make a comparative study by comparing the merits and demerits of the domains of Procedural programing and Object Oriented Programming. Argue on the different features with supporting examples to make your point (Can include code snippets as examples)

* Give some insight as to how the features above are actually implemented in real life and what are the advancement brought about in these languages over the years. It is suggested that you use C++ for this demonstration. However you can also use OOP languages to demonstrate the same, the decision is left upon the interviewee.


<div align="justify">
Please remember to keep the presentation short and concise. Long presentation bores the audience and you will also get tired of presenting. It has also been observed that images, quotes, interactive programming sessions tend to keep the audience interested in the content. (Recommended: Keep the presentation within 20 slides). The Interviewee should be also prepared for questions regarding the topics being presented by him/her.

## Tech Stack

<div align="justify">
For this task no prior knowledge of programming is also fine since the interviewee will be majorly making a comparative study into the domain of paradigms of programming. However prior knowledge in some programming language might give you a head start as to understanding what is happening behind the scenes in languages like C++/Java.
</div>

## Learning from the task
* One of the most important skills that a student will learn is how to google. Obviously not everyone is acquainted with all the technical background and while making the presentation, the interviewee will learn more about how to google correct information and gather relevant data properly from the chunk of web pages that google will throw at you on a search query. The resources provided will give you a head start but they are not complete.

* For this task we are expecting that the interviewee doesn't have experience in programming (basic task). The interviewee will gain some basic knowledge as to when the application of each paradigm is more helpful

* An in depth comparative study will improve our decision making skills and trying to defend the position as to why object oriented programming is beneficial in the domains that you support will also give you in depth knowledge of the benefits of OOP.
