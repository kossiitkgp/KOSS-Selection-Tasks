## What you need to do

* You need to give a talk explaining newer git concepts like git bisect.
* You need to prepare slides for your presentation.
* The presentation should be about 10 minutes in length.
* The presentation should explain the following concepts:
  * git stash
  * git bisect
  * git reflog
  * git diff
  * git switch
  * git rebase
  * git cherry-pick
* You need to give examples and explain them.
* You can also give a live demo if you wish.

**Please remember to keep the presentation short and concise. Long presentation bores the audience and you will also get tired in presenting. It has also been observed that images, quotes, interactive programming sessions tend to keep the audience interested in the content. (Recommended: Keep he presentation with 20 slides). Interview should be also prepared for questions regarding the topics being presented by him/her.** 

## Tech Stack

No prior knowledge of coding is required for this task. Some basic knowledge of git is good.

## Learning from the task

You are encouraged to Google this topic further and use technical blogs to understand this better so that you can explain it well. Git is a very powerful tool and understanding these concepts will help you utilize its power.
