## Background 

- Go is an open source statically-typed, compiled high-level programming language developed by a team at Google and many contributors from the open source community. 
- According to the developers of Go, before Go was developed, one had to choose from either efficient compilation, efficient execution, or ease of programming, as all three were not available in the same mainstream language, but Go was designed to be all three.
- Syntactically, it is quite similar to C, but with additional features such as memory safety, garbage collection, and most importantly, concurrency, which is the focus of this teaching task. 

## Relevant Materials

- [The official tour](https://go.dev/tour/) of Go, which is a great way to get started with the language. The first few sections could be completed quickly as it just covers the basic syntax of the language, but the later sections are more interesting and cover some of the more advanced features of the language, which will be useful for this task.
- [Go by Example](https://gobyexample.com), which is a great resource for learning Go with ample examples.
- Go's [official documentation](https://golang.org/doc/), which is another great resource for learning the language.
- If you are stuck at any point, just consult the creators of the language, Google $:)$. There are a lot of resources available online for learning Go, and you will find the answers to most of your questions on the internet.

## What you need to do

- You need to give a talk about concurrency, and how concurrent programming is different from sequential programming, including its benefits.
- You need to explain how concurrent programming is done in Go, through Goroutines, Waitgroups, Channels, and Mutexes. 
- You are also encouraged to talk about how concurrency in Go is different from concurrency in other languages like Python.
- You can also give a live demo of the code, if you wish.
- The talk should be about 10 minutes in length.

**Please remember to keep the presentation short and concise. Long presentation bores the audience and you will also get tired in presenting. It has also been observed that images, quotes, interactive programming sessions tend to keep the audience interested in the content. (Recommended: Keep he presentation with 20 slides). Interview should be also prepared for questions regarding the topics being presented by him/her.**


## Learning from the task

While you must already have some experience programming in a language like C/C++ or Python, you might not have any experience with concurrency. So, this task not only aims to introduce you to a new language, Go, but also teach you about concurrency in Go. You will learn about the syntax of the language, and how concurrency is done in Go. You will also learn about the benefits of concurrency, and how it is different from sequential programming.
