## Garbage Collection: Algorithms and Language Differences

### Background

Garbage collection is a crucial aspect of memory management in programming languages, allowing for automatic memory deallocation of unused objects. This process helps prevent memory leaks and reduces the risk of dangling pointers.

### Tasks

Create a presentation covering the following topics:

- Research the inner working and purpose of Garbage collections with different implementations in different languages.
- Overview of common techniques used in garbage collection (e.g., tracing vs. reference counting ) along with the advantages and limitations of different approaches
- Compare and contrast garbage collection mechanisms in languages (can be your choice but do cover most famous languages or those having distinctive properties)
- Discuss how memory leaks occur and strategies for preventing them.
- How circular references are handled in different languages.

### Additional Tips

- Include diagrams to illustrate key concepts.
- Use real-world examples to demonstrate the impact of garbage collection on application performance.
