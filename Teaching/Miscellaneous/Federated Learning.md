# Federated Learning (Features and Comparative Study)
 
## Background:
In traditional machine learning, data is centralised in one location, which makes it easier to train and improve machine learning models. However, when dealing with sensitive or private data, it is often difficult or impossible to collect and store data in one place. Federated Learning is a new approach to machine learning that allows for training models on decentralised data.

## What you need to do:
The interviewee needs to make a presentation (keep the presentation simple, a simple PowerPoint presentation is good enough). The interviewee needs to keep in mind that the crowd he will be presenting to, will have mixed people of different knowledge levels, so it is advised that to keep the content balanced for all, touch upon both basics and advanced topics in the domains below. Your presentation should mainly consist of the following parts:
1. Introduce the concept of Federated Learning and explain why it's an important development in the field of machine learning. Try to provide a comparative study with traditional machine learning concepts.
2. Explain how Federated Learning works, including the role of the client, server, and aggregator.
3. Provide examples of applications where Federated Learning can be used, such as healthcare, finance, and transportation. Provide examples of successful federated learning implementations and their impact.
4. Discuss the benefits of Federated Learning, such as privacy preservation and the ability to leverage distributed data.
5. Highlight the challenges and limitations of Federated Learning, such as communication overhead, security risks, and the need for robust algorithms.
6. Provide an overview of the existing federated learning frameworks and tools available for implementation, such as TensorFlow Federated, PySyft, and IBM Federated Learning. Describe their features and limitations, and provide examples of their usage. Provide  simple code examples (preferably Python or any language of your choice ) to demonstrate how Federated Learning works in practice.
7. Summarize the key points covered in the presentation and provide a concluding discussion on the potential of federated learning for future machine learning applications. Allow time for questions and open discussion with the audience.
Please remember to keep the presentation short and concise. Long presentation bores the audience and you will also get tired in presenting. It has also been observed that images, quotes, interactive programming sessions tend to keep the audience interested in the content. (Recommended: Keep the presentation with 20 slides). Interview should be also prepared for questions regarding the topics being presented by him/her.

## Tech Stack:
The presentation can be created using any presentation software, such as Microsoft PowerPoint or Google Slides. Knowledge of machine learning and programming is beneficial but not required.

## Learning from Task:
- Understanding the concept of federated learning and how it differs from traditional machine learning approaches.
- Understanding the benefits and drawbacks of using federated learning in various contexts, such as privacy concerns and the need for distributed computing resources.
- Learning about the technical components involved in federated learning, such as the client-server architecture and the use of secure aggregation.
- Getting hands-on experience with implementing federated learning, possibly through a simple coding exercise or a demo using a pre-built framework like TensorFlow Federated.
- Learning about real-world use cases of federated learning, such as mobile device usage prediction or medical research applications.
- Developing critical thinking skills by analyzing the trade-offs involved in using federated learning versus other machine learning approaches in different scenarios.
- Improving communication and presentation skills by creating a clear and concise presentation or report that explains the concept of federated learning to a non-technical audience.
- Improving research skills by exploring additional resources on federated learning and related topics, such as differential privacy or edge computing.
