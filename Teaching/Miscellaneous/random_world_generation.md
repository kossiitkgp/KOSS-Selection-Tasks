# Random World Generation

## Background

In the game development industry, the ability to generate a random world efficiently is of paramount importance. Whether it's creating expansive open-world environments, dynamic levels, or unique landscapes, random world generation adds a layer of unpredictability and replayability to games. Various algorithms and techniques are employed to craft diverse and engaging virtual worlds, each offering a different approach to simulate natural, visually appealing, and immersive environments.

## Task Description


- Research different ways in which world generation is achieved (e.g., Perlin noise, simplex noise, cellular automata, Voronoi diagrams).
- Focus on understanding how the algorithm was developed. Shed light on why and where the algorithm is used and its disadvantages
- Create visual representations or diagrams that illustrate how each algorithm influences the generated worlds.
- Emphasise the unique visual styles and characteristics brought about by each algorithm.
- Some of these algorithms can be computationally expensive and slow to run. Research how people optimised these techniques to be viable for use in high performance applications
- Your task is to put together a presentation showcasing your work, including detailed documentation of how you learned and progressed throughout the project.
- Optionally you can implement one or more of these world generation using a library/game engine of your choice (e.g. OpenGL, pygame, godot, unreal engine, etc.)
