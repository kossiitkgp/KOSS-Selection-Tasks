# OpenGL Shaders

## Background

OpenGL shaders are programs written in a specialized shading language (such as GLSL - OpenGL Shading Language) that run on the GPU to perform various graphics rendering tasks. Shaders are an essential part of modern graphics programming and are used to control the appearance of objects and surfaces in a 3D scene.

## Task Description

- Learning to create an OpenGL Project in C++ and rendering objects
- Understanding the basics of OpenGL shaders, including their role in graphics rendering and the types of shaders available (vertex, fragment, geometry, compute).
- Study the shader pipeline in OpenGL, including how shaders are compiled, linked, and executed on the GPU.
- Learn the syntax and structure of GLSL shaders, including variable declarations, control flow statements, and built-in functions.
- Research into advance shader techniques such as HDR Lighting, post processing effects and lighting models (such as Blinn-Phong).
- Your task is to make a presentation showcasing everything you learnt, and explaining the OpenGL Rendering Pipeline.
- It is recommended to make an OpenGL project of your own, implementing everything you learnt and showcasing it during the presentation.
