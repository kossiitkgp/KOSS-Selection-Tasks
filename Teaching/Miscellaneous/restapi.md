# REST APIs

## Background:

Consider a scenario where you are using the Swiggy app. Now, obviously, this application needs a lot of Input data, as the data present in the application is never static. Either it is the restaurants available on a frequent basis, or various menu items at various times of the day. Itâ€™s never static which implies to the fact that data is always changing in these applications.

Now, where do you think we get this data from? Well, this data is received from the Server or most commonly known as a Web-server. So, the client requests the server for the required information, via an API, and then, the server sends a response to the client.

The data returned by the server, in response to the request of the client is either in the format of JSON or XML. Both JSON and XML format have a proper hierarchical structure of data.

Now, this sounds quite simple, right? But, the only issue which is present in this framework till now is that you have to use a lot of methods to get the required information. To the fact, using these methods to retrieve information, becomes quite cumbersome when you require complex data.

So, this is where REST API comes into the picture. The REST API creates an object, and thereafter send the values of an object in response to the client.

## What do you need to do:

The student needs to make a presentation (keep the presentation simple, a simple PowerPoint presentation is good enough). The interviewee needs to keep in mind that the crowd he will be presenting to, will have mixed people of different knowledge levels, so it is advised that to keep the content balanced for all, touch upon both basics and advanced topics in the domains below. Your presentation should mainly consist of the following parts:

- What is an API?
- What are REST APIs?
- REST API Methods
- How to cons an API (can create a simple frontend or a cli that uses a public api available)
- Creating a basic API (you can use Flask)

**Please remember to keep the presentation short and concise. Long presentation bores the audience and you will also get tired in presenting. It has also been observed that images, quotes, interactive programming sessions tend to keep the audience interested in the content. (Recommended: Keep he presentation with 20 slides). Interview should be also prepared for questions regarding the topics being presented by him/her.**

## Materials:

- https://github.com/public-api-lists/public-api-lists
- Google xD

## Tech Stack:

However newbies having basic programming knowledge can also be alloted. 

## Learning from the Task:

- Foremost and major skill that a student will earn is to how to google. Obviously not all person are acquainted with all the technical stuffs and during the making of the presentation, interviewee will learn more about how to google for correct information and gather relevant data properly from the chunk of web pages that google will throw at you on or search query. The resources provided will give you a head start but are not complete resources.

- Finally if you are new to programming domain, you get a head start on one of the simplest and easy to learn concepts in programming.
