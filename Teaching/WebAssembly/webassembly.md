## Background

WebAssembly is a technology in web development growing in popularity for complex/time-consuming computational tasks. It is an assembly-like language which can run with near-native performance on most browsers.
Released in 2017, most major browsers now support running WebAssembly 1.0 modules in a virtual machine, to be used alongside JavaScript, since by itself it doesn't support features like DOM access.  
While a lot of popular languages can be compiled to WebAssembly, C++ and Rust are very commonly used.  

## What you need to do:

The interviewee needs to make a presentation and present the topic from a teaching-oriented standpoint. The interviewee needs to keep in mind that the crowd he will be presenting to will have mixed people of different knowledge levels, so it is advised to keep the content balanced for all, touching upon both basic and advanced topics in the domains below. 
Your presentation should cover the following parts, but can go beyond it:

- The motivation behind developing and using WebAssembly
- How it runs on a browser
- Textual format of source code
- Writing wasm modules in C++/Rust
- Loading and using WASM modules via the JavaScript interface.
- Test performance comparison between JavaScript and WASM code on your machine on different browsers.

## Materials:

- [MDN Docs for WebAssembly](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAssembly)
- [WebAssembly Developer's Guide](https://webassembly.org/getting-started/developers-guide/)
- [Rust and Webassembly Book](https://rustwasm.github.io/docs/book/)


## Technical Prerequisites:
It is preferable for the interviewee to know the basics of JavaScript and C++/Rust, but can be done otherwise.

## Learning goals:
- You will learn about an upcoming technology in web development, used extensively to port computationally expensive programs to the web, like Photoshop and Figma.
- Develop an idea about how content is delivered on the web, and how JavaScript and WebAssembly run on browsers.
- Learn to analyze real performance data and justify it according to your learning.
