# Install Arch Linux

## Background
One of the benefits of using a Linux-based distribution is the scope for customizability. You can customize everything from the theme and icons to the sound server, which handles audio processing internally.
Most Linux distributions, such as Ubuntu or Linux Mint, ship with these systems already configured to make it simple to use. Arch Linux takes a different approach to *simplicity* by only including the bare essentials required to make a *working* operating system. The user has to install and configure all the extra packages.

Arch Linux provides a simple CLI-based installer, and the user has to do everything from setting the timezone to installing the drivers to setting up the GUI. Due to this, Arch Linux is considered to be very hard to install. But if you manage to install it, you would learn a lot along the way about the internals of a Linux-based operating system, and you would also be entitled to use the phrase "I use Arch BTW." everywhere.

## What do you need to do
- Read the [Arch Wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/).
- Go through the [installation guide](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Installation_guide). You must follow the default installation guide and not any alternative installation processes.
- Install Arch Linux in a [Virtual Machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_machine) such as [Virtualbox](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/VirtualBox/Install_Arch_Linux_as_a_guest).
    - Your Arch installation must include at least the following: A working network connection, a working desktop environment, essential apps such as a browser, and a cool theme and customizations :)
    - There is no limit to how much you can customize your Arch install. You may take ideas from the internet and make the coolness over 9000.
- (OPTIONALLY): If you feel confident enough, install Arch Linux bare-metal on your computer.

If you face any issues during the installation process, feel free to search it on the web, and if no solution is found, feel free to ask on the Arch Linux [forums](https://bbs.archlinux.org/).

We know that this task involves learning about many concepts, so we do not expect you to become masters in just a couple of days. We want to see what you've explored, the effort you've put into this, and how you overcame any hurdles.

Please create a presentation, either using PowerPoint or its alternatives, Google Slides, or using a tool such as RevealJS. Mention everything you learned about Linux, all the issues you faced, and how you fixed them. The focus should be on what you learned about Linux rather than Arch Linux in particular, but you can include some background about the Arch installation process.

The presentation must also be titled "I Use Arch BTW!" and must flex about all the cool customizations you made to your Arch installation.
