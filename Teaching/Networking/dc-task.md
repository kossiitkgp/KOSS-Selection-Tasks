# Find the room where Metahub/DC++ is hosted

## Backround

Metahub is a Direct Connect (DC) Hub for IIT Kharagpur. 
It is a private hub and can only be accessed from within the IIT Kharagpur network. Users can connect to this hub using DC clients and share files at high speeds. 
DC++ is a free and open-source, peer-to-peer file-sharing client that can be used for connecting to the Direct Connect network.

## What you need to do:

Install and configure the DC++ client and connect to the Hub address: dc.metakgp.org (Over institute wifi/LAN).
Try to find where Metahub is hosted on the campus, you don't have to find the exact room but try to narrow it down as much as possible
Create a presentation which includes the following, but can go beyond this:

- Documentation on your entire process, motivation and reasoning on the steps you followed to find and narrow-down the hub's location, any challenges you faced.
- Explaining new concepts you came across while working on this task (things like P2P networks, PtokaX etc.)
- Your understanding of the underlying technology and protocols involved in running the hub.

- [subnets list](add link here)
- [A guide on Networking Concepts](https://beej.us/guide/bgnet0/html/split/index.html)

## Technical Prerequisites:

Some basic knowledge of networking concepts required

## Learning goals:

- Explore and understand the underlying networking concepts technology involved in running the DC Hub.
- Apply these learnings to solve a real world task
