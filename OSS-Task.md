# The Open Source Task

There are a lot of really awesome open source projects out there. If you've ever been a developer, chances are, you have used one. In fact, nearly all the languages themselves are open source!

This task is not just for selections into KOSS. We give you the opportunity to work on any proper open source project, on any major platform (such as GitHub, GitLab, or even e-mail'ed patches) to encourage you to become an OSS contributor. You can even mention this task on your CV if you are a dedicated contributor to any project!

## The Task

You have to create **one Pull Request** on any proper project, Hacktoberfest style!

## Rules

1. The pull request MUST NOT be a trivial one. You cannot just change one line of README or fix indentation.
2. You can either work on the documentation or the codebase itself. Bear in mind, if you are working on documentation, the result should especially be a significant improvement.
3. It has to be done on someone else's repository, not your own.
4. The repository you are working on must atleast be somewhat famous:
   - It can be a library or application that is not much used, as long as it is actually used by other people.
   - Big projects are highly welcome.
   - If you are unsure whether the repository will count towards your selections, feel free to contact us.
5. Repositories which do not serve any real life purpose (such as [TheAlgorithms](https://github.com/TheAlgorithms) are STRICTLY FORBIDDEN.
   - This means you cannot just submit a CP-like/algorithmic solution to a project that is just a storage of different algorithms.
   - You can, however, create a pull request that changes the algorithm of an application or library to make it more efficient.
6. It is not necessary that the pull requests be merged. Merged requests, however, are highly appreciated.
7. **If you have created a major pull request in the past 6 months on a big project, we can consider that**. Keep in mind that this is only for big projects, and the change has to be a substantial one.

## Tech Stack

Anything! Feel free to use any programming language in existence, as long as you are contributing to a proper repository.

Even if you don't know enough programming, you can work on documentation for a project.

## Learnings

- You learn how to give back to the community. Fell in love with a programming language, a library or an open source application? It's time to show them your love by improving their project!
- Prior experience with working on big projects are highly valued in the industry. If you are applying for a job or even an internship, if you have contributed to open source before, it will be a major point to talk about during your interview.
- It is also an excellent way to learn coding in itself. There will be people to correct your mistakes, and you learn two very important skills: reading others' code, and coding in a compliant manner, such that it is readable by others.
- If nothing else, you get prepared to get a free t-shirt during [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.com/), which is what this task is based on.
- Finally, it's fun! We here at the Kharagpur Open Source Society love contributing to projects simply for the fun of it. We get to be a part of bigger communities, interact with famous people (such as the maintainers of big projects), and learn how to code properly.
