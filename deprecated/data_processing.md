# Data Processing

## Story
Out here is KOSS, we have various task related to data processing. We get lot of data of users which we need to pre-process in an efficient way such that it can be used by other team members for further ado.

## Materials
* CSV file containing the data in an un-processed manner
* `format.txt` file which tells you the format of data that you need to process into a JSON format.

## What you need to do
* You will be given a csv file which contains dummy data in the same format that we get while conducting Kharagpur Winter of Code. You have to pre-process the data into the given format in `format.txt`  and output into a `JSON` file.
* You need to document your approach in a `.md` file explaining your thought process and how / why you choose a certain tool while solving this problem.
* A GitHub repository which contains your code and the output `.json` file along with a `.md` file containing your thought process would be the end product that we are expecting.

## Tech-Stack
* You can use any programming language and tools that are available, however make sure that you are ready to explain why you chose that and the pros / cons that you encountered while using that.

## Learning from the task
While you must have some experience with programming while doing this task, we know beforehand that this task would be difficult for people who don't have much experience with back-end.
So, you are encouraged to google the technical stuff that you have encountered out here, use technical blogs to understand and practically implement it.
Note that, don't get lost in the theoretical sea, there are infinite topics in back-end which are impossible to know, so you should use the rule of thumb to judiciously use your time to maintain a balance of theoretical understanding and practical implementation.
_We are more curious about your thinking ability and practical utility than the final result._
