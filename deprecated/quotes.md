# Quotes

Anyone likes a useful quote like anything. A good quote can make one's day and inspire us to take challenges for the day. Alice decides to automate the above task, and decides to write up a program to do the above stuff. Can you help Alice in doing it?

## Materials

* Nothing as such :P

## What you need to do
* Use the [Quotes API](https://theysaidso.com/api/) to access and present a quote for the day.
* Use the documentation to add in more features.
* You have to create a command line interface **CLI**  which would accept the data from the user and accept the following option for displaying the meta-data for the above.
* You need to document your approach in a `.md` file explaining your thought process and how / why you choose a certain tool while solving this problem.
* A GitHub repository which contains your code along with a `.md` file containing your thought process would be the end product that we are expecting.

## Tech-Stack

* You can use any programming language and tools that are available, however make sure that you are ready to explain why you chose that and the pros / cons that you encountered while using that.

## Learning from the task

While you must have some experience with programming while doing this task, we know beforehand that this task would be difficult for people who don't have much experience with back-end.
So, you are encouraged to google the technical stuff that you have encountered out here, use technical blogs to understand and practically implement it.
Note that, don't get lost in the theoretical sea, there are infinite topics in back-end which are impossible to know, so you should use the rule of thumb to judiciously use your time to maintain a balance of theoretical understanding and practical implementation.
_We are more curious about your thinking ability and practical utility than the final result._
