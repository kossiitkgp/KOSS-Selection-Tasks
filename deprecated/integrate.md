# Story
While working on frontend, the developer's responsibility also includes to display the data sent from the backend on the site in a proper way. This process of integration can be sometimes frustating but is a very essential part of web development.

# Materials
- Usage of fetch API(Alternatives like axios, superagent are welcome :) )
- CSS designing of cards

# What you need to do
- You will be given a REST API along with details:
On a successful GET request at `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/photos` you will get an array of the following objects like this
```
 "albumId": 1,
    "id": 4,
    "title": "culpa odio esse rerum omnis laboriosam voluptate repudiandae",
    "url": "https://via.placeholder.com/600/d32776",
    "thumbnailUrl": "https://via.placeholder.com/150/d32776"
```
After you get the response from the backend in json, you need to show the data as cards.You need to design cards which can display the images(thumbnailUrl or url), and show the title below it.

# Tech Stack
You can use what ever the frontend web technologies you are aware of, it can be a stack consist of HTML, CSS, Vanilla JS or Jquery or Typescript, or any frontend framework like React JS, Angular, Vue, or Svelte.js anything you are comfortable with.

# Learning from the task
You will learn how to use the fetch API(or its alternative), play with JSONs and array iterable functions in javascript. You can prove your CSS skills in the card design by making the page neat and responsive.
Even you are not able to complete the task, we would like to see what all research you have done and what you learnt from the experience.
