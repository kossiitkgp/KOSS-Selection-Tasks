# Capture the flag

## Story

What goes on inside a binary file is much more interesting than the C code you write to make that file.
People think that none can read the binary files and hence tend to keep their secret keys in plaintext format directly inside them.
Let's see if you have the mettle to find out the hidden key in one such executable.

## Materials

- A bianry file `crackme` which can be run in Linux environment as :
  `./crackme <flag>`
  If your flag is correct it will show `Flag is correct`, otherwise no output will occur.
  
## What do you need to do

Find the flag :-)

Make Github Gist mentioning the flag and the process of getting to it in a `.md` file.

## Tech-Stack

You can use `gdb` or any reverse engineering software like `Ghidra`.

## Learning from the task

While you must have some experience with programming while doing this task, we know beforehand that this task would be difficult for people who don't have much experience with back-end. So, you are encouraged to google the technical stuff that you have encountered out here, use technical blogs to understand and practically implement it. Note that, don't get lost in the theoretical sea, there are infinite topics in back-end which are impossible to know, so you should use the rule of thumb to judiciously use your time to maintain a balance of theoretical understanding and practical implementation. We are more curious about your thinking ability and practical utility than the final result.
