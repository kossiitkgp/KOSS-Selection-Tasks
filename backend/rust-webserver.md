# Writing a simple Web Server with Rust!

Write a multithreaded web server using only the standard library that:
- Listens on a specified port (5000/8000)
- Has a single endpoint, that serves 1 HTML file, along with CSS and a JS script.
- Can handle upto 4 incoming connections at a time. 
- Has a counter that counts the number of visitors that have visited the site.

You are not allowed to use external crates and only can use the `std` crate for the webserver.

Explain in detail how Rust's borrow checker and type safety provides advantages for safety.

(Optional) Tell us how you could deploy this application using Docker. This is purely an optional component, and you could feel free to ignore
