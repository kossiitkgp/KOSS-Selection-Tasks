* Implement a search functionality, which based upon the keyword or phrase given by the user, updates the UI to display only those images whose title or description contains that keyword.For bonus points, try to implement any search algorithm like fuzzy search or substring matching from scratch instead of using any external library.
* Make an attractive and responsive UI to display the images in a grid or carousel format.
